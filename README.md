We first use Mathematica to obtain data of 2018,2019 and 2021 from NCAA offical website and make it a csv file, then we cleaned the data by using pandas(python) to only obtain the information of Won-lost percentage, offense score, assist, field-goal percentage and defense score, we write an algorthim that give those data field different portpotion in team's strength, and use this algortim to predict with data from 2018 and 2019, and change the portpotion accordingly,  then we decided to use it to predict the 2021's bracket.
